# Ansible Role: aci-model
A comprehensive Ansible role to model and deploy Cisco ACI fabrics.

This role provides an abstraction layer that is convenient to use. By providing your required configuration (a structured dataset) in your inventory this role will perform the needed actions to ensure that configuration is deployd on your ACI infrastructure.

Using this role you can easily set up demo environment, maintain a lab or use it as the basis for your in-house ACI infrastructure. It can help you understand how ACI works while prototyping and testing. No prior Ansible or ACI knowledge is required to get started.

## Requirements
This role requires the **aci_rest** module and the standard set of ACI modules from Ansible v2.4.

## Installation

### Install the aci-model role
There are two ways you can test this role:

 1. Installing it by cloning the Github repository

        git clone https://github.com/hsabale/ansible-aci

 2. Install it using the ansible-galaxy command

        ansible-galaxy install datacenter.aci-model


### Install the aci filter plugin
In order to work with the provided ACI topology, a custom Jinja2 filter (*aci_listify*) is needed.
You need to configure your Ansible to find this Jinja2 filter. There are two ways to do this:

 1. Configure Ansible so it looks for the custom aci filter plugin:

      ```ini
      filter_plugin = /home/ansible/ansible-aci/plugins/filter
      ```

 2. Copy the filter plugin (*plugins/filter/aci.py*) into your designated filter plugin directory

Because of its general usefulness, we are looking into making this *aci_listify* filter more generic and make it part of the default Ansible filters.


## Using the example playbook

### Configure your APIC host and credentials
Look inside the inventory and provide the needed information.

#### Role variables
The role accepts various variables, including:

- apic_host
- apic_username (defaults to 'admin')
- apic_password
- apic_use_proxy (defaults to false)
- apic_validate_certs (defaults to true)

You can configure these as part of your host variables, or group variables.

### Ensure the playbook can find your ansible-aci role
If you cloned it from Github, ensure you cloned it to a directory named ansible-aci.
Otherwise the playbook will not find the role with name "ansible-aci".

### Running the playbook
This is tested on latest ansible version

    ansible-playbook -i myinventory.yml myplaybook.yml -v
